# Background

- What are seeds?
- Seeding methods
- Leveraging the friendship paradox

# Problem introduction

## Alexander et al.

- Pair has higher diffusion to non targeted nodes 
- Two seed triangles cause higher prob of adoption

---

# Problem introduction

## What we looked at

- How successful was each seeding method in reaching more central nodes (correlation between seeding vs. centrality)? <!-- might be able to explain result in alexander -->
- Does the seeding method impact the number of two-seed triangles?
- Does the seeding method impact the spread of innovations in a simple threshold model?
