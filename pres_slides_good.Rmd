# Background

- Seeds: the initial nodes which receive an innovation
  - Choosing seeds with high centrality, shown to lead to greater diffusion

- Seeding methods: random, friend and pair
  - Utilise the Friendship paradox

# Results from Alexander et al.'s (2022) seeding study

- Pair seeding has higher diffusion to non-targeted nodes (nodes that weren't seeds)
- Non-targeted node has highest probability of adopting an innovation if it's part of a two-seed triangle

# Research questions

.pull-left[

- How successful is each seeding method in reaching more central nodes? 

<br>

<br>

- Does the seeding method impact the number of two-seed triangles?

<br>

<br>

- Does the seeding method impact the spread of innovations in a simple threshold model?

# Does each seeding method reach central nodes?
## Approach: correlation 

For a node, we simulated its probability of being selected as a seed:
  - Run several seeding iterations
  - Simulated probability  = proportion of times it got selected as seed

We then converted these probabilities to ranks. 

We also ranked nodes by their centrality measures 

$\rightarrow$ Pearson rank correlation

# Correlation between seeding method and centrality 

```{r}
cor_mat = read_csv("correlations_dat.csv") %>% 
  select(contains("weaver"), `Targeting Method`, `Measure`) %>% 
  set_names(c("aves_weaver_social", "Targeting Method", "Measure")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Measure`, values_from = aves_weaver_social) %>% 
  column_to_rownames("Targeting Method")

cor_mat = rbind(cor_mat[3,], cor_mat[2,], cor_mat[1,])

cor_mat %>% 
  heatmaply::heatmaply(show_dendrogram = c(FALSE, FALSE), main = "Correlation heatmap on the Aves weaver network (N = 445)",key.title = "Spearman", cellnote = round(as.matrix(cor_mat), 2))#, Rowv = FALSE
```

# Two-seed triangles

- Alexander et al.found that untargeted nodes had the highest probability of adoption, when they were in a two-seed triangle

- Diffusion is not only about the neighbours initially targeted, the connection between neighbours (triangles) is also important

# Impact of seeding method on spreading dynamics

## Proportion adopted afte 20 time-steps vs q

```{r}
g = readRDS("plotly_figures/qVSprop.RDS")
# g = g  +
#   theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = rel(0.8), angle = 90))
ggplotly(g)

# Impact of seeding method on spreading dynamics

## Critical q vs N

```{r}
g = readRDS("plotly_figures/nVScascade.RDS")

# g = g  +
#   theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = rel(0.8), angle = 90))
ggplotly(g)
```

---

# Conclusion

- Friend method correlated with centralities more than the pair method

- Pair seeding method can sometimes reach more two seed triangles and hence may be able to propagate diffusion

- Choice of seeding can impact the spreading of innovations
